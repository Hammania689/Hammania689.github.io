          For the summer of 2019, I will be working with <a href="https://dritchie.github.io">Dr. Daniel Ritchie</a> at
          Brown University. His broad research focus is in the intersection of computer graphics with artificial
          intelligence and machine learning. Our project will focus on training a computer vision task which can take an
          incomplete point cloud representation of a scene and predict which parts of which objects in that scene can be
          interacted with and how they can move.

    <h2 id="week">Week 1: June 3rd - 7th</h2>

    <p>Upon moving in and meeting my mentor as well as the research team, I was given an in-depth introduction to
      the current project and research efforts that have been developed over the past year. Also, learned that there
      was one week left to meet the International Conference on 3D Vision June 10th paper deadline. The gist of the
      project is that we further segment existing 3D models into individual components and provide an initial seed
      or batch of manual kinematic annotations which are then used in conjunction with Geometric Sampling and
      shallow Machine Learning algorithms to suggest possible new kinematic annotations. In conjunction with my
      first week in the lab, I had several social events to attend for another summer program that I am apart of at
      Brown. Thus far, I am enjoying my time here and look forward to the weeks to come. </p>

    <h2 id="week">Week 2: June 10th - 14th</h2>

    <p>The entire research team worked through the weekend to meet the deadline for 3DV. It was rather intense yet
      rewarding at the same time. I feel more comfortable communicating with my mentor and others in the lab. Once we
      met our deadline, my mentor let us rest and take it easy for the next few days. We convened later in the week to
      discuss action items to polish our current work and also met with a PhD student from another lab to discuss a
      potential collaboration with his work and our current dataset. Although things have slowed down, between reviewing
      literature suggest by mentor as well as the PhD student and action items there is still plenty to do. I am beyond
      pleased to be apart of this lab and learn from everyone here.</p>

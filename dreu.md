###### Senior at the University of Southern Mississipi majoring in Computer Science. Expected to graduated in December 2019.

###### For the summer of 2019, I will be working with [Dr. Daniel Ritchie] at Brown University. His broad research focus is in the intersection of computer graphics with artificial intelligence and machine learning. Our project will focus on training a computer vision task which can take an incomplete point cloud representation of a scene and predict which parts of which objects in that scene can be interacted with and how they can move.
